# Advanced API Development with Django REST Framework

This project focuses on advanced concepts in API development using Django REST Framework, such as custom serializers, generic views, filtering, searching, ordering, and unit testing. By the end, you will build robust APIs capable of handling complex data and advanced querying.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up a Django project with custom serializers for complex data structures.
- Build and customize views to handle CRUD operations.
- Implement filtering, searching, and ordering in API endpoints.
- Write comprehensive unit tests for API functionality and security.

## Repository Structure
- **`advanced-api-project/`**: Main Django project directory.
- **`api/`**: Application for API logic.
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for API endpoints.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Project dependencies.

## Tasks Overview
### 1. **Setup and Custom Serializers**
- Define models (`Author`, `Book`) with relationships.
- Create custom serializers to handle nested data and add validation.
- Run migrations and test models and serializers.

### 2. **Custom and Generic Views**
- Implement CRUD operations with generic views.
- Add custom behavior for Create and Update views.
- Apply permissions to secure endpoints.

### 3. **Filtering, Searching, and Ordering**
- Integrate filtering, searching, and ordering for API views.
- Use DRF features like `DjangoFilterBackend`, `SearchFilter`, and `OrderingFilter`.
- Test query capabilities for robustness.

### 4. **Unit Testing**
- Write unit tests to verify API functionality, data integrity, and permissions.
- Test CRUD operations, query features, and access control.
- Ensure all endpoints return correct status codes and responses.
